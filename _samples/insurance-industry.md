Good Morning RECIPIENT,

I’ve had a lot of time to think about my future over the past year while watching my son grow during our maternity leave. Over the past two and a half years at BUSINESS I’ve learned this is an environment that rewards commitment and work ethic with long-term growth. While looking for growth opportunities on the BUSINESS careers website I spotted an opportunity as a POSITION that my university degree, accomplishments as a CURRENT POSITION, and a decade of customer service experience make me a top-choice candidate for.

I’m currently working as a CURRENT POSITION in the Winnipeg BUSINESS under the leadership of EMPLOYER and have been here for nearly 3 years. I have learned a great deal during my time in this department including a fluent familiarity with the benefits program, internal & client claims reporting and adjustments with SOFTWARE, and a proficient expertise in navigating PRIVATE applications while managing contributions to the pilot program.

I understand how important it is to have team awareness in an environment like ours and an attitude of supporting the group as a whole can make a big difference in the department's capability. I’ve always taken an unexpected lull in the work queue as an opportunity to offer my support to colleagues that need it to ensure my time is spent where it will help the department achieve the best results. My educational background in math, computer science, desktop publishing, accounting/bookkeeping, and customer service coupled with my decade of experience defusing customer service challenges, managing & training teams, and supporting business growth have given me the awareness necessary to spot an opportunity in the POSITION role that needs me.

I have attached a copy of my resume for your review and I would welcome an opportunity to address any questions you have. As a full-time employee at BUSINESS Great-West Life I'm available all day and can start immediately. I can be reached at EMAIL and TELEPHONE.

Thank you for your consideration,<br>
CLIENT
