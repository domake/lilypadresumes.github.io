<p>Good Morning Mr. Baltar,</p>

<p>My name is Client and I am a leader, expert, athlete, entrepreneur, dynamite designer, and front end developer. I’ve spent the last 4 years honing my graphic, web, and marketing design skills to an expert level and I’m nowhere near ready to slow down. I’ve heard a lot about what it’s like to work at Mars Unitted from my brother, James; “An environment where people are given opportunity, and the tools they need to thrive.”</p>

<p>Mars United has built a reputation in our industry synonmous with momentum, perseverence, and expertise. When I heard there was a seat at the table open for a designer that can help Mars United set the bar higher, I knew we needed to talk. <strong>I want to be involved.</strong></p>

<p>Since graduating from the Digital Media Design program at Mars Univserity in 2162 I’ve contributed to over 100 projects that have helped stumbling businesses find their stride, ideas find their voice, and experts shine as thought leaders in their industry. During my time on the Modern Utopia Web Design team I helped over 30 projects reach the finish line on time and on budget.</p>

<p>The tools, processes, and frameworks I built and advocated for transitioned Modern Utopia from 90% Cold-Fusion development based projects to 90% WordPress. This streamlined their process and saw immediate returns for the business <strong>effectively reducing production costs of nearly every project by an average 25-30%!</strong> Meeting every challenge ready to learn enabled me to grow development, problem-solving, business savvy, and leadership skills that will influence Modern Earth for years to come.</p>

<p><strong><em>This is the kind of dedication I want to bring to your team at Mars United.</em></strong></p>

<p>I’ve attached my resume for your team to review and maintain an extended summary of my education, experience, and expertise on my LinkedIn Profile.</p>

<p>A portfolio of my strongest work is available at [Link] with a few notable highlights that showcase an array of my most valuable skills:</p>

<ul>
  <li>[Link] - Best looking e-Commerce Project</li>
  <li>[Link] - Best looking Brand/Logo work</li>
  <li>[Link] - Most effective client goal achieved.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d really enjoy an opportunity to discuss the design position available, and how I can help Mars United make a positive impact as a growing leader in e-commerce.</p>

<p>I’m available at this email address or via telephone at [tel].</p>

<p>Cheers!<br />

<p>Good Morning RECIPIENT,</p>

<p>I’ve had a lot of time to think about my future over the past year while watching my son grow during our maternity leave. Over the past two and a half years at BUSINESS I’ve learned this is an environment that rewards commitment and work ethic with long-term growth. While looking for growth opportunities on the BUSINESS careers website I spotted an opportunity as a POSITION that my university degree, accomplishments as a CURRENT POSITION, and a decade of customer service experience make me a top-choice candidate for.</p>

<p>I’m currently working as a CURRENT POSITION in the Winnipeg BUSINESS under the leadership of EMPLOYER and have been here for nearly 3 years. I have learned a great deal during my time in this department including a fluent familiarity with the benefits program, internal &amp; client claims reporting and adjustments with SOFTWARE, and a proficient expertise in navigating PRIVATE applications while managing contributions to the pilot program.</p>

<p>I understand how important it is to have team awareness in an environment like ours and an attitude of supporting the group as a whole can make a big difference in the departments capability. I’ve always taken an unexpected lull in the work queue as an opportunity to offer my support to colleagues that need it to ensure my time is spent where it will help the department achieve the best results. My educational background in math, computer science, desktop publishing, accounting/book-keeping, and customer service coupled with my decade of experience defusing customer service challenges, managing &amp; training teams, and supporting business growth have given me the awareness necessary to spot an opportunity in the POSITION role that needs me.</p>

<p>I have attached a copy of my resume for your review and I would welcome an opportunity to address any questions you have. As a full-time employee at BUSINESS Great-West Life I’m available all day and can start immediately. I can be reached at EMAIL and TELEPHONE.</p>

<p>Thank you for your consideration,<br />
CLIENT</p>

<h2 id="tvradio-broadcasting-cover-letter">TV/Radio Broadcasting Cover Letter</h2>

<p>Hello CBC Radio­-Canada!</p>

<p>My name is Client Name and I’m a creative marketing professional and new media designer living in Winnipeg. I am writing today to submit my candidacy for the Senior Designer ­English Services (WIN00406) position available at your organization.</p>

<p>The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and I have something essential in common that greatly influences my life and my work: reverence for the storyteller. A story without artful, captivating telling is powerless to influence and change its audience. As a professional creative communicator I strive to express stories,messages, or ideas clearly and precisely through thoughtful presentation.</p>

<p>Throughout my career I’ve had the opportunity to hone a range of skills, many of which I would use every day as a Senior Designer with CBC Radio-Canada. After over a decade of producing media for video, web, and print, I have developed a strong familiarity with the Adobe Creative Suite. Additionally, I’ve worked on a variety of projects in programs and applications such as After Effects, Combustion, Keynote, PowerPoint, Quark Xpress, Toon Boom Studio, and Maya.</p>

<p>As a web designer and project manager for Metric Marketing over the last three years, I’m also very comfortable with deadline driven schedules and using web­ focused tools such as Dreamweaver, Flash/JavaScript, HTML/CSS, PHP, and MySQL. My recent photographic experiments resulted in an invite to participate in a local art exhibition. This required that I developed new pre-­press techniques to ensure colour reproduction would be true to my work’s original intent.</p>

<p>My genuine passion for language and communication paired with my extensive skill set makes me an ideal candidate for this position. Working in an environment focused on contributing meaningful stories and knowledge for Canadians while shaping the way we share information as a people is my calling. Given the opportunity, I believe I could produce my best work with the CBC.</p>

<p>My resume is attached for your review and I would like to invite you to have a look at my online portfolio which showcases my design work and describes some of the projects I’ve been a part of in greater detail.</p>

<p>My portfolio: [link]</p>

<p>Project highlights include Cottage Grove at Pelican Lake ­ Corporate Branding, Print, Web Design: [link]</p>

<p>Canada’s Web Shop Promotional Video ­ Conceptualization, Directing, Producing: [link]</p>

<p>I can be reached for further discussion any time at my personal number TELEPHONE, or via email at XXX.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br />
Client Name</p>

<h2 id="request-for-proposal">Request for Proposal</h2>

<p>Good morning, Mr. Marcown,</p>

<p>I was pretty intrigued when you messaged me Monday evening regarding the BUSINESS homepage you’re seeking to have redesigned. I knew immediately this was a project I’d absolutely love to be involved in. My name is Brad, and you reached out to me on reddit where I use the alias /u/***.</p>

<p>The part of me that loves to dream about the future was completely starstruck by cryptocurrency technology when I was first exposed only a few short years ago. I was thirsty to get involved and offered my expertise as a designer and online marketer to the industry growing around the blockchain. I spent the entirety of 2014 working with a number of teams building coins, exchanges, trading tools, apps, and hardware. My family didn’t really understand the projects I was working on, but that didn’t stop me from enthusiastically gushing about the work.</p>

<p>I’d love to help you update the BUSINESS design to make it more fresh and modern, but I think we can do better than that. I think that together we’ll not only be able to increase the signup conversions on your service but also shift your messaging to appeal to a broader target market and secure a larger share in your industry.</p>

<p>I’m at a distinctly unique advantage to help with this. For the past 2 years of my 7 year career I’ve been helping e-commerce companies increase sales, generate more customers, and develop effective marketing tools while working at Shopify’s largest app producer and expert custom development shops, REDACTED. I’ve been learning e-commerce from one of the top achieving teams in the industry you’re marketing to every single day.</p>

<p><strong>I can think of a few projects that I was able to help grow from an idea to profitable that you might like to take a look at.</strong></p>

<p><em>ZeroValue</em> took us a few months to get off the ground but our team of 5 managed to sell $10,000 in $50 recurring revenue subscriptions within the first 30 days after launch.</p>

<p>I worked extensively with the Minacoin team before the project was axed on both their point-of-sale site, and briefly on the conceptualization stages of an exchange they were building.</p>

<p>I’m also currently working on the REDACTED team where I function as the lead designer and front-end developer to code all of the elements our users interact with. This week we launched a new sales tool for crowdfunding campaigns that help them survey their backers for choices about their rewards. <strong>The tools I designed helped CLIENT sell an additional $20,000 in up-sells during the survey process, <em>and that’s just our first client.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>I’d love to help you achieve results like this with your service.</em></strong></p>

<p>Immediately I noticed a few design choices that are worth discussing. First off the logos and colors are really effective but the site lacks a personality that helps merchants relate the solutions you’re offering to the problems they came to solve. Inviting imagery of people in the setting your ideal customer is most familiar with could go a long way to help your audience feel like your service addresses their specific needs. The mobile view suffers from a ‘stacking effect’ that could use a bit of love to capture the attention of your audience more effectively.</p>

<p>The most important change in expanding the BUSINESS market share and appealing to broader market of customers is a shift in the messaging Bitcoin payment processing services are currently using to communicate to store owners. Bitcoin is an incredibly niche tool, really only used by enthusiasts. Your messaging says “Hey, if you’ve been thinking about accepting bitcoin payments. We can help you”. Most store owners aren’t thinking about accepting bitcoin payments. I’d shift your approach slightly to “There are millions of people in control of $12B in digital currencies that are looking for stores to spend it on. Get in on the ground floor and accept digital currencies. We’ll convert them into your converted into your local currency at no risk so you can capitalize on this hungry market.” Clearly it could use some fine-tuning but I think if you started positioning your messaging to offer solutions to the problems e-comerce stores are having in the way they think about them you’d start seeing your conversion rates rise.</p>

<p>I’m currently billing at $60USD/hr and I should be available in a full-time capacity as early as July. Hiring me to help out would provide your business with a design and front-end development expert actively involved in the most effective teams working on the fastest growing e-commerce tools available today that cares more about your conversion rates and revenues than just filling a role.</p>

<p>Feel free to say no, but is that what you had in mind?</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Hello Techwise Brandstop!</p>

<p>My name is Client Name and I’m a UI/UX designer, developer, entrepreneur, partner, consultant, expert, and father. A colleague recently alerted me to the Web Design Ninja position currently available at your organization and I think I’d be a perfect fit. Great things can happen in an environment full of individuals who believe in, and enjoy what they do. You guys do a great job at showcasing a culture and environment that reflects those admirable traits and <em>I want to be involved.</em></p>

<p>The psychology of influence that marketing and design hold over the decision making process is a fascination of mine. I’ve been honing an expertise with the Adobe Creative Suite for over 15 years, and have been practicing professionally for 6 years with adept knowledge of branding, illustration, print, video, motion graphics, and photography. My most valuable expertise lies in user interface design &amp; development with some of my most visible work reaching 42 million users, and some of my most effective work increasing a client’s online sales by 300%.</p>

<p>Since graduating Digital Multimedia Technology at Red River, I maintain an up-to-date familiarity with the latest CSS, HTML, Javascript, jQuery, and Mobile/Responsive design/development techniques. I’ve worked adeptly in a team environment but also thrive independently and have maintained a self sustained freelance employment as well as launched my own business. I can’t exactly claim a professional level foosball or nunchuck mastery, but I am building a motorcycle in my basement that could prove to be an effective getaway vehicle for whatever you have planned for your nunchuckers.</p>

<p>I’ve attached my resume for your review, and have an extended summary of my expertise, credentials, and experience on my LinkedIn profile, with a body of my work on my portfolio.</p>

<p>A few recent notable projects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Crypto-Market Assistant by ZeroValue</li>
  <li>BullBear Analytics</li>
  <li>Cottage Grove Manitoba</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts and get a meeting on the books to discuss the potential to work together on your Picticipate brand. I’m available at this email address or via telephone at TELEPHONE</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
