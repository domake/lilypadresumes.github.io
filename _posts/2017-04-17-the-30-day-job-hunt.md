The unemployed job hunt is one of the most emotionally draining experiences many of us have ever undertaken. The amount of effort required is exhausting, and the pressure from our families and friends is nearly debilitating. Bills continue to pile up constantly reminding us that another day without an interview is another failed day.

I used to scour job boards looking for work I qualified for that didn't look awful. I'd run those boards dry and apply for as many as I could. I was desperate to feel in control of my life but when the last application went out it wasn't a satisfying accomplishment. I had run out of options and was once again not in control of my life.

The following days would be even worse. Only one or two opportunities would trickle in over the course of the next week. Once the well dries up, the waiting game is hard.

This approach is common but it didn’t take me long to realize that it’s a flawed process. Finding work doesn't have to feel like this. It can be rewarding, empowering, and leave you guilt-free to relax after a hard day's job hunt.

Here's how a new strategy it worked for me and how it can work for you too.

## Your New Full-Time Job

When you're unemployed finding work becomes your full time job. Your bills don't take weekends off, so neither do you. As we discussed, using job boards is a depressing way to watch your sense of control over your life evaporate, so we're not going to use them much. Instead we'll be selling you directly to business owners, and if they're smart - they'll smell an opportunity to grow their business and make room for you.

Start working on the most important part of the 30 day method - **The List**. Fill your list with all of the businesses you want to work at. You can add businesses from job boards to your list, but don’t limit yourself to just businesses with active job postings. Spend some time researching the industry in your region and write down the players.

Next you need to pick a number of applications you can realistically send out every day. Depending on what's going on in your life a realistic number might be as low as 3 or as high as 6. Keep in mind that every application is very likely 1 to 2 or more hours of work each. If you don't know where to start, try 4. Budget your time appropriately. I’m a firm believer that the average person only has about 4-6 hours of producivity at the ready every day.

Today, fill your list. Tomorrow, send out 4 applications. Ensure your list never shrinks small enough that you need to search for businesses before sending out applications. Re-fill your list with enough businesses to hit your outgoing application quota for tomorrow at the end of each day.

That's it. When you complete 4 outgoing applications you're done. Fill your list for tomorrow if needed and then go take a break. Watch a movie, take a walk, play some Xbox guilt free. You accomplished your goal and you're done for the day.

4 outgoing applications per day is 120 applications by day 30. I've used this method to find work 4 times at major crossroads in my life and every time I've had a job offer by the end of week 3.

## Secret Weapons
I prepared for weeks using this method as my college graduation approached and It all paid off. I was the first of my graduating class to get a job. I started the very next day after classes ended.

Persistence is a powerful ally that this strategy relies on but without your job finding tools in top form it won’t be easy to get your foot in the door.

Your job finding tools are your resume, and your cover letter and many people misplace the importance in these documents. Your resume backs up your claim that you can speak the right language and handle the job you're applying for but your cover letter convinces the recipient that it would be a mistake to pass up an opportunity to interview an incredibly valuable asset. Your cover letter is the most important part of this entire game and most of your daily effort should be spent on tailoring a cover letter that convinces the recipient that you are a valuable investment presenting yourself as an opportunity to grow their business. And just to be clear: If you’re sending an email to a business with your resume attached, the email is your cover letter. You don’t need to attach a cover letter AND a resume.

I follow a tested format that has secured job offers for every client that has followed it so far: Introduce your triumphs and goals - mention a sound byte of your most effective professional accomplishment and humanize yourself with your latest personal goals. Are you training for a marathon? Just celebrated a big anniversary? Avid Home-brewer? Pick one and get it in there.

Start the next paragraph by offering a bit of admiration for the business, and then offer a bit more admiration for what could be accomplished together. Finish with excitement and desire for that fantasy of what could be and suggest, to mutual benefit, the first step of establishing dialogue so an interview can be booked.

The key is to always keep your audience in mind. The audience of your cover letter is often someone very focused on business growth, and return on investment. Hiring an employee is an investment so appealing to the readers desire to grow and expand their business might be your ‘in’.

From a business owners perspective the resume is about qualifying ability, but the cover letter is about finding great people. If your resume qualifies you, and your cover letter makes the reader feel like there's a human being on the other end with a rich lifetime of experiences, relationships, and challenges which we all undeniably possess; then you'll receive just as much interest in you as you're sending out.
